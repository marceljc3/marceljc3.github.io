Hello everyone! This is Marcel. I have finally gotten around to making at least a simple site to tinker around with static pages (and until I maybe make a more technically impressive website). I am a third-year standing Computer Science student who is very interested in multiple aspects of the field. I like math, software, security and solving complex problems. 

On this site you will find some of my projects, ways to contact me as well as some blog posts for when I have some thoughts wandering around that I want to put onto paper. I've been meaning to write a little more.

For now though - if you, dear reader, have any inquiries or even just want to talk, you can check out my [github] or [email me]!
